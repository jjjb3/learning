# learning
first try

I work in a very small IT department. One director, one network guy (my husband), one report writer and me. We are home grown, home schooled in the IT world for the most part(except for our director who is strictly a network guy himself). The internet is our lifeline to learning what we need to know to do our jobs. 

I may not know the proper techy lingo, but I have been getting done what needs done for almost 25 years. I had a paralegal degree and a husband who needed to move to the country to take care of his parents, so here we are in the middle of the woods at the lake. Which is not at all a bad thing. We don't get rich, but we are happy and that is what is important.

My job description here is pretty much taking care of anything I feel I can handle and just recently being able to use consultants to handle anything else we may need here. After about 15 years of nothing new being implemented, the use of consutants has proven to be more of a necessity as the desire to move forward has finally become a priority thanks to a new CFO.

I have to say that I am not comfortable with being on the outside looking in and not knowing how the new technology is being implemented as I am moving more toward a project manager/analyst than a developer. We had a flurry of projects over the last 2 years or so that I have no idea how they were designed and I really want to figure this all out.

I had been advised by a consultant who used to work on a couple of our projects that I should begin with Dapper .Net and that is why I have downloaded GitHub. I was told we have a standard .net & sql server setup with a library called dapper used for the object mapping. The consultants wrote a WPF Application, a .Net MVVM website and a Windows service using .NET, C#, Telerik, WCF Dapper, LINQ, Caliburn Micro, Etnerprise Framework Bootstrap, Kendo UI. All of which are new to me (and may not be comma separated properly, time will tell). I taught myself Classic ASP, jscript, Visual Basic, XML and XSL in order to maintain a system put in place (not by me) back in 1999. All was cutting edge back then, but I have come to learn the 1999 now non-standard practices left us married to Microsoft browser. So as you see I have a long way to go as we slowly transition and rebuild. I am sure that the process will be similar, it's just wading throught the new terms and tools.

So I begin....
